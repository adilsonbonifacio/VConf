We have four (4) input parameters for the tool:
1) IOVPTS model of the specification
2) IUT IOVPTS model
3) VPA for the desirable language
4) VPA for the undesirable, or "failed", language

The IOVPTS model text file must be described as follows:
1) The first 5 lines define the sets of actions:
  line 1, CALLs;
  line 2, RETURNs;
  line 3, INTERNALs;
  line 4, INPUTs;
  line 5, OUTPUTs.

2) Sixth line defines the stack symbols

3) Line 7 describes the set of model states

Note that: 
a) At each line, elements are separated by commas
b) For an empty set, we leave a blank line (skip a line) in the file

4) From line 8 onwards, we define the model transitions. Each transition must be in the form s,a,Z,q, line by line, where s is the source state, a is the action, Z is the stack symbol and q is the target state.

5) After all transitions symbol #  indicates the end, and on the next line put the initial state. Then put the symbol - (dash) to indicate the end of the specification. For instance:
#
s0
-

Similarly, we describe a VPA model, with the following adjustments:
1) Delete lines 4 and 5 (since doesn't make sense INPUT and OUTPUT sets)
2) After the set of states (line 5, formerly 7), also define the set of final states
3) For the empty word (\epsilon) we use the symbol @, similarly to \varsigma (internal)

Remarks:
1- Whenever there are more items (symbols, states, actions, etc.) per line, separate them with a comma.
2- Do not add any symbol (dot, semicolon, etc.) at the end of each line.
3- If any set is empty (for example, the model has no internal actions), leave a blank line.
4- A simple transition (from Li) or an internal transition (with \varsigma) is defined by @ for the stack symbol, in the same vein for the empty symbol \epsilon.
5- The empty stack symbol (\bot) is defined by *.

Run the command line "python2.7 DCCL.pyc $1 $2 $3 $4" in a shell where $1, $2, $3, and $4 are the models' text files of the specification (IOVPTS), IUT (IOVPTS), VPA for the desirable language and VPA for undesirable language, respectively.

Example: 

	python2.7 DCCL.pyc iovpts-spec.txt iovpts-impl.txt vpa-D-anbnx.txt vpa-F-anbn+1.txt
